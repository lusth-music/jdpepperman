When you come to me
All I can do is see you clearly

And when you go away 
All I can do is ask you to stay

chorus

And as we go from here
I want nothing more than to draw you near

To hold you oh so close
But when you leave I feel so lachrymose

chorus

bridge

But now that I'm with you
I feel like I have wanted to

Cause now that you're mine
Its like I'm always drunk on high dollar wine
