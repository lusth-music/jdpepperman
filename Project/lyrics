When you come to me
All I can do is see you clearly

And when you go away 
All I can do is ask you to stay

I wish we could take it back to the start
Where I'd give you it all

And I know if we did you'd be mine forever and ever oh yeah

And as we go from here
I want nothing more than to draw you near

To hold you oh so close
But when you leave I feel lachrymose

I wish we could take it back to the start
Where I'd give you it all

And I know if we did you'd be mine forever and ever oh yeah

So I spill my heart to you 
And I tell you how I really feel

And you feel the same way too
So we back to the beginning

And now that I'm with you
I feel like I always have wanted to

Cause now that you're mine
Its like I'm always on high dollar wine

So we took it back to the start
And I give you my all

And I know we'll always be together forever oh yeah
